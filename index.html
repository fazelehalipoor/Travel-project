            Shiraz the city of
          </h3>
          <p>
            Shiraz[a] is the fifth-most-populous city of Iran[b] and the capital of Fars province,[5] which has been
            historically
            known as Pars (پارس) and Persis.[6] As of the 2016 national census, the population of the city was 1,565,572
            people, and
            its built-up area with Sadra was home to almost 1,800,000 inhabitants.[7] A census in 2021 showed an
            increase
            in
            the
            city's population to 1,995,500 people.[8] Shiraz is located in southwestern Iran on the rudkhaneye khoshk
            (lit. 'dry
            river') seasonal river. Founded in the early Islamic period, the city has a moderate climate and has been a
            regional
            trade center for over a thousand years.

            The earliest reference to the city, as Tiraziš, is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BCE.[9] The modern
            city
            was
            founded by the Sasanian dynasty and restored by the Umayyad Caliphate in 693 CE and grew prominent under the
            successive
            Iranian Saffarid and Buyid dynasties in the 9th and 10th–11th centuries, respectively. In the 13th century,
            Shiraz
            became a leading center of the arts and letters, due to the encouragement of its ruler and the presence of
            many
            Persian
            scholars and artists. Two famous poets of Iran, Hafez and Saadi, are from Shiraz, whose tombs are located on
            the
            north
            side of the current city boundaries.

            <h2>Nasir al-Mulk Mosque</h2>
            <p>
              also known as the Pink Mosque (Persian: مسجد صورتی, romanized: Masjed-e Surati), is a mosque located in
              Shiraz, in the
              province of Fars, Iran. Completed in 1888 CE, the Qajar era mosque is located in the Gowd-e Araban
              district
              of
              Shiraz,
              south of Lotfali Khan Zand Street, next to the Shāh Chérāgh Mosque.

              The mosque includes extensive stained glass in its façade, and displays other traditional elements such as
              the
              Panj Kāse
              ("five concaved") design.[2]

              The mosque was added to the Iran National Heritage List in 1955, administered by the Cultural Heritage,
              Handicrafts and
              Tourism Organization of Iran. The mosque is a major tourist attraction in Shiraz, especially when the
              light
              hits the
              stained glass at sunrise.
